# Founders & Coders Code Test 

This project represents a basic html web page that pulls in the top news stories from an ITV News API feed. 

### The tasks

1. Run the application locally in a browser. Do you notice any bugs with the way the news stories display? Identify any bugs you find by listing them in the `test-journal.md` file, and suggest any code fixes as another commit to the pull request. 

2. Make some improvements to the styling of the application, so that it displays correctly on small screens (e.g. mobile phones) and larger desktop displays. Add these improvements as another commit to the pull request. Add an explanation for your changes in the `test-journal.md` file.

3. People use ITV's products and services on a wide range of devices. It's important that our websites are accessible for people using assistive technology like screen readers. Identify improvements to the accessibiltiy of the html markup and add your code improvements as another commit to the pull request. Explain why you made your changes in the `test-journal.md` file.

4. Make suggestions to improve the codebase including any refactoring you think would be beneficial. Add your improvements as an extra commit to the pull request. Note your reasoning in the `test-journal.md` file.

5. Bonus task: We have added a test framework using Jest. Add some additional tests to check that the core functionality of the application works as expected. You may find the documentation at  [https://testing-library.com/docs/](https://testing-library.com/docs/) and [https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-startedhelpul](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) helpful. Add any notes to the `test-journal.md` file.
